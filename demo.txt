I am Dinesh Reddy Maley studying 4th Btech in department of Automobile Engineering in VNR VJIET.
I completed my schooling from rural village of Nalgonda disstrict.As Iam from a rural background I don't have very good communication skills when I entered this college and i dont even know how to operate a system. It become very tough for me at the inital stage of my college but my  strength is my hardwork and I worked very hard to overcome from it.At present I am better compared to initial days of my college.
